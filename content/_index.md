# Hi, I'm Richard 

<!-- ![Avatar](/images/avatar.png 'Avatar') -->

A recent Computer Science Graduate from Flinders University, with a solid educational foundation, which includes a stint as an intern at an Ag-Tech startup, FLUX Robotics, it has equipped me with a comprehensive understanding of a software engineer.

A lifelong computer enthusiast, I have been driven by a passion for tinkering, building, and innovating. From childhood, I've embraced the thrill of crafting creations and even "enhancing" already-existing ones. I am deeply engaged in the open-source community and hold a keen awareness of the significance of a digital footprint, prioritizing a privacy-first mindset. 
Beyond the screen, I also find joy in the arts and association football.

With my academic background and previous experiences have equipped me with a strong foundation in technology and a deep interest in emerging trends like AI and Robotics, I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to the dynamic landscape that awaits ahead.
